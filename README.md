# Adakite Library

This library consists of utility classes and methods that may or may not be useful in your projects. Many classes and methods may be absent or different in other libraries.

Breaking changes may be introduced to existing code during library updates at any time without warning until development stablizes.

The source code in this library was originally written for and included in [DropLauncher](https://github.com/adakitesystems/DropLauncher). I decided to turn many general classes into a small library of its own.
