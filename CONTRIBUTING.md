## Code Conventions

I loosely follow [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). The main conventions I would like to enforce are:
* Two-space indentions (no tab characters)
* Egyptian braces
* As little amount of static methods in non-utility classes as possible.
* /\* Single-line comment style \*/
* //Temporary comment style
